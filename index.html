        <h2>ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Worked on a startup idea - TAKE2</strong><br>
            I am working on an idea, which will act as a marketplace. We pitched in an interschool competition and secured the first position. Next day our school bought in few investors who were ready to invest Rs 10 Lakhs in our idea. We declined the offer as our preboards and boards were about to start. We started working on it after our boards ended and joined a startup started by IITians, with a similar idea, as co-founders and we became semi-finalists in HULT PRIZE.

            <strong>Got in a teenage incubation programme - Clever Harvey incubation programme</strong><br>
            Worked on an idea in class 11, pitched it to many founders and CXOs, got into a teenage incubation programme by Clever Harvey where only 20 teams were selected. Had a team of teenagers who had interned at various companies and startups like Deloitte, Goldman Sachs, Nova Social (startup by IIT BHU passout), VC firms, PE firms, nonprofits like Tech Help For All, etc. Unfortunately, due to high capex requirements, we weren't able to build our prototype and raise funds.
